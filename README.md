# Hospital
Hospital is a main Windows Forms application and can be used to manage doctors, nurses and administrators in hospital or clinic.
On first startup you need to create admin account in order to manage all users.
Users (doctors and nurses) can only see names, surnames and proffession of their colleagues. They can also add, edit or delete they own shifts which can only occur no more than 10 times in selected month, in one day only one doctor per proffession can hold a shift. Administrator can see all data including PESEL (Polish electronic population register system) and PWZ number. In addition to that they can manage all users shifts and of course manage all staff (adding new members, editing them and deleting).
